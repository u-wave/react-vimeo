| onPlay | function |  | Triggered when the video plays. |
| onPause | function |  | Triggered when the video pauses. |
| onEnd | function |  | Triggered any time the video playback reaches the end. Note: when `loop` is turned on, the ended event will not fire. |
| onTimeUpdate | function |  | Triggered as the `currentTime` of the video updates. It generally fires every 250ms, but it may vary depending on the browser. |
| onProgress | function |  | Triggered as the video is loaded. Reports back the amount of the video that has been buffered. |

| onCuePoint | function |  | Triggered when the current time hits a registered cue point. |
| onVolumeChange | function |  | Triggered when the volume in the player changes. Some devices do not support setting the volume of the video independently from the system volume, so this event will never fire on those devices. |
